<objective>
Create a comprehensive Statistics Resource Notebook document that serves as Blake's reference guide during the midterm exam. This notebook should contain all essential formulas, interpretation templates, procedures, and examples organized for quick access during test-taking.

The resource notebook is explicitly allowed during the midterm (mentioned in the quiz instructions), making it a critical study and test-taking tool.

<context>
Blake is preparing for a statistics midterm covering:
- Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, IQR, outliers)
- Data Display (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)
- Normal Distributions (Empirical Rule, z-scores, percentiles)
- Correlation and Regression (LSRL, residuals, r-squared, interpretations)
- Sampling and Experiments (bias types, random assignment, confounding, statistical significance)

**Blake's Known Weaknesses (Must Emphasize):**
- Slope interpretation with scaled variables (needs template with unit conversion reminders)
- Residual sign interpretation (needs clear +/- meaning)
- Complete explanations for bias (needs structure for HOW it affects results)
- Extrapolation reasoning (needs reminder about data range)
- Statistical significance (needs simulation vs. actual clarification)

**Teacher's Expectations:**
- Complete interpretations with units and context
- Specific statistical vocabulary
- Templates: "The predicted [y] increases/decreases by [slope] [y-units] for each [x-unit]"
- Explanations must include WHY, not just WHAT

**Files to Reference:**
- @"Stats/Prepare/Chapter 3 Study Guide.txt" - Contains templates and formulas for regression
- @"Stats/Prepare/Chapter 4 Study Guide.txt" - Contains bias types and experimental design
- @"Stats/Prepare/Chapter 3 Quiz Analysis.txt" - Shows Blake's specific mistakes and corrections
- @"Stats/Guide/STAT Midterm Exam Study Guide 2025-2026.pdf" - Teacher's official topics list

**Special Sections for Blake's Weak Areas:**

For Slope Interpretation:
```
⭐⭐⭐ SLOPE INTERPRETATION (CRITICAL - BLAKE'S #1 WEAKNESS) ⭐⭐⭐

TEMPLATE:
"The predicted [y-variable with units] increases/decreases by [slope value]
[y-units] for each additional [one unit of x] [x-units]."

⚠️ SCALED VARIABLE WARNING:
If x is in thousands: multiply slope by 1000 to get per-unit interpretation
If x is in millions: multiply slope by 1,000,000
If y is in thousands: slope is already in thousands

EXAMPLES:
1. ŷ = 45.2 + 0.18x where y = price (thousands of $), x = square feet
   Slope = 0.18 thousand dollars = $180
   Answer: "The predicted house price increases by $180 for each additional
   square foot."

2. ŷ = -112.58 + 21.83x where y = crimes, x = enrollment (thousands)
   Slope = 21.83 crimes per thousand students
   Answer: "The predicted number of property crimes increases by 21.83 crimes
   for each additional thousand students."

⚠️ BLAKE'S COMMON MISTAKE: Multiplying by random numbers (like 100).
DON'T DO THIS. Just use the slope value with correct units.
```

For Residual Signs:
```
⭐⭐⭐ RESIDUAL INTERPRETATION (CRITICAL - BLAKE'S #2 WEAKNESS) ⭐⭐⭐

FORMULA: Residual = Actual - Predicted

SIGN INTERPRETATION:
• POSITIVE residual (+) = Actual ABOVE line = MORE/HIGHER than predicted
• NEGATIVE residual (-) = Actual BELOW line = LESS/FEWER/LOWER than predicted

TEMPLATE:
"The [subject] had [|residual| value] [more/fewer, higher/lower] [y-variable]
than predicted by the least-squares regression line."

EXAMPLE:
Predicted GPA: 3.4, Actual GPA: 3.1
Residual = 3.1 - 3.4 = -0.3
Answer: "The student had 0.3 lower GPA than predicted by the regression line."

⚠️ BLAKE'S COMMON MISTAKE: Getting the magnitude right but saying "more" when
the residual is negative. NEGATIVE = FEWER/LOWER, NOT MORE!

VISUAL REMINDER:
    + (positive) = ↑ above line = more/higher
    - (negative) = ↓ below line = less/lower
```

**Example: Complete Section for Descriptive Statistics**

```
SECTION 1: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
==================================

MEASURES OF CENTER
------------------

Mean (Average)
• Formula: x̄ = Σx / n
  - x̄ = sample mean
  - Σx = sum of all values
  - n = number of values
• Example: Data: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25
  x̄ = (12+15+18+20+25) / 5 = 90/5 = 18
• Properties: Affected by outliers, uses all data

Median (Middle Value)
• Definition: Middle value when data is ordered
• Formula:
  - If n is odd: middle value
  - If n is even: average of two middle values
• Example: Data: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25
  Median = 18 (middle value)
• Properties: Resistant to outliers

Mode (Most Frequent)
• Definition: Value that appears most often
• Example: Data: 12, 15, 18, 18, 20
  Mode = 18
• Note: Can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes

MEASURES OF SPREAD
------------------

Range
• Formula: Range = Maximum - Minimum
• Example: Data: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25
  Range = 25 - 12 = 13

Interquartile Range (IQR)
• Formula: IQR = Q3 - Q1
  - Q1 = first quartile (25th percentile)
  - Q3 = third quartile (75th percentile)
• Example: Data: 12, 15, 18, 20, 25
  Q1 = 15, Q3 = 20
  IQR = 20 - 15 = 5
• Properties: Resistant to outliers

Standard Deviation (s)
• Formula: s = √[Σ(x - x̄)² / (n-1)]
• Interpretation: Average distance from the mean
• Calculator: Use 1-Var Stats function
• Properties: Affected by outliers, same units as data

⚠️ OUTLIER IDENTIFICATION RULE
Lower fence: Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
Upper fence: Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
Any value below lower fence or above upper fence = outlier

Example:
Q1 = 20, Q3 = 36, IQR = 16
Lower fence: 20 - 1.5(16) = 20 - 24 = -4
Upper fence: 36 + 1.5(16) = 36 + 24 = 60
Is 65 an outlier? YES (65 > 60)
```

```
SECTION 4.1: SLOPE INTERPRETATION
==================================
⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL - BLAKE'S #1 WEAKNESS ⭐⭐⭐

SLOPE (b) IN REGRESSION EQUATION: ŷ = a + bx

DEFINITION:
The slope tells you how much y changes for each one-unit increase in x.

⭐ INTERPRETATION TEMPLATE:
"The predicted [y-variable name with units] increases/decreases by
[slope value] [y-units] for each additional [one unit] [x-units]."

UNIT CONVERSION RULES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
If x is measured in THOUSANDS:
  → Slope is already "per thousand"
  → Don't multiply by anything
  → State "for each additional thousand [x-units]"

If y is measured in THOUSANDS:
  → Slope is in thousands
  → Can convert to regular units by multiplying by 1000
  → State both if helpful

If x is measured in regular units but y is in thousands:
  → Slope is in thousands
  → Can say "increases by [slope] thousand" or "[slope × 1000]"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Basic (no scaling)
ŷ = 12.5 + 2.3x where y = GPA, x = hours studied per week
Slope = 2.3
✓ CORRECT: "The predicted GPA increases by 2.3 points for each additional
hour studied per week."

Example 2: Y in thousands
ŷ = 45.2 + 0.18x where y = price (thousands of $), x = square feet
Slope = 0.18 thousand dollars = $180
✓ CORRECT: "The predicted house price increases by $180 for each additional
square foot."
✓ ALSO CORRECT: "The predicted house price increases by 0.18 thousand dollars
for each additional square foot."

Example 3: X in thousands
ŷ = -112.58 + 21.83x where y = crimes, x = enrollment (in thousands of students)
Slope = 21.83
✓ CORRECT: "The predicted number of property crimes increases by 21.83 crimes
for each additional thousand students."

Example 4: X in thousands, negative slope
ŷ = 15.2 - 0.003x where y = enrollment (thousands), x = tuition ($)
Slope = -0.003 thousand = -3 students
✓ CORRECT: "The predicted enrollment decreases by 3 students for each
additional dollar of tuition."
✓ ALSO CORRECT: "The predicted enrollment decreases by 0.003 thousand students
for each additional dollar of tuition."

⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
✗ Don't multiply slope by random numbers (like 100 or 1000) unless converting units
✗ Don't forget units - "increases by 21.83" is INCOMPLETE
✗ Don't say "for every 21.83 students" - that's backwards!
✗ Don't forget to say "thousand" if variable is in thousands

🔴 BLAKE'S SPECIFIC ERROR PATTERN:
On Quiz Q2a: Wrote "by ONE for every 2183 enrollments"
WHY WRONG: Multiplied 21.83 × 100 for no reason. The slope 21.83 is already
correct - it means 21.83 crimes per thousand students.

CORRECT ANSWER was: "by 21.83 crimes for each additional thousand students"

REMEMBER: The slope value is correct as-is. Just add the right units!
