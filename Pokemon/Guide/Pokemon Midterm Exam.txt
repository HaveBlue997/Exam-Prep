Section C — Short Answer (2 questions)

Directions: Answer in 3–6 sentences each. Include at least one type matchup in your explanation.
	26.	You are battling and your opponent sends out Charizard (Fire/Flying).
Name two good types to attack Charizard with, and explain why each is a good choice.

Correct Answer (example response):
	•	Rock is strong because it hits Charizard’s Fire/Flying typing super-effectively (it’s one of Charizard’s biggest weaknesses).
	•	Electric is also good because it is super-effective against Flying types, so it can deal strong damage to Charizard.
(Other acceptable types: Water can be strong vs Fire, but Rock is the clearest “best” answer; a well-justified explanation earns full credit.)

	27.	Explain the difference between evolution and a regional variant, and give one example of each.

Correct Answer (example response):
	•	Evolution is when a Pokémon changes into a new species in its evolution line, usually becoming stronger (example: Charmander → Charmeleon → Charizard).
	•	A regional variant is a different version of a Pokémon that changes appearance and may change typing depending on the region (example: Alolan Vulpix as a regional form).
