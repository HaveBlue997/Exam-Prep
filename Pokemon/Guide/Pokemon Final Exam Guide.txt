Intro to Pokémon — Final Exam Study Guide (Semester 1)

What the final will test

You’ll be asked to show you can:
	•	Identify Pokémon (name, type, basic role) and recognize common forms (evolution lines + variants).
	•	Use type matchups to predict what’s strong or weak in a battle scenario.
	•	Explain strengths/weaknesses for the 10 focus Pokémon and defend choices with clear reasoning.

1) Must-Know “10 Focus Pokémon” Checklist

For each one, you should be able to say:
	1.	Type(s)
	2.	Two strengths (what it’s good against / what it can do well)
	3.	Two weaknesses (what threatens it and why)
	4.	A basic battle role (examples below)

The Focus 10
	•	Pikachu — Electric
	•	Charizard — Fire/Flying
	•	Blastoise — Water
	•	Venusaur — Grass/Poison
	•	Gengar — Ghost/Poison
	•	Lucario — Fighting/Steel
	•	Gyarados — Water/Flying
	•	Eevee — Normal (plus Eeveelutions overview)
	•	Snorlax — Normal
	•	Gardevoir — Psychic/Fairy

Study move: Make a 1-page “mini-card” for each Pokémon with those 4 items.

2) Forms You Need to Understand

You don’t need to memorize every generation’s special gimmicks, but you do need to know what each category means and recognize examples.

A) Evolution & Evolution Lines
	•	What “evolution” means
	•	What an “evolution line” is
	•	Know at least these lines cold:
	•	Charmander → Charmeleon → Charizard
	•	Squirtle → Wartortle → Blastoise
	•	Bulbasaur → Ivysaur → Venusaur
	•	Pichu → Pikachu → Raichu (if covered in class)

B) Regional Variants
	•	What a regional variant is (different look + sometimes different type based on region)
	•	Be able to explain why game designers do this (new twist on an old idea)

C) Alternate Forms (as covered in class)
	•	Be able to explain the concept even if you don’t memorize tons of examples:
	•	“Same Pokémon, different form = different stats/type/ability/look”

⸻

3) Type Matchups — What you must be fluent in

You should be able to do these quickly without a chart for common types.

Core vocabulary (likely on matching/multiple choice)
	•	Type
	•	Super-effective
	•	Not very effective
	•	Resist
	•	Weakness
	•	Immunity
	•	Dual-type

The “Core Eight” types to master

These come up constantly in our focus list:
	•	Fire, Water, Grass, Electric
	•	Flying, Rock, Ground
	•	Psychic, Fairy
	•	Ghost, Poison
	•	Fighting, Steel
	•	Normal

(Yes, that’s more than eight—because the semester’s Pokémon force you to know them.)

Fast matchup facts (high-priority)

Make sure you know:
	•	Water > Fire, Fire > Grass, Grass > Water
	•	Electric > Water and Electric > Flying
	•	Ground > Electric
	•	Rock > Flying and Rock > Fire (and why this is scary for Charizard)
	•	Ghost > Ghost and Ghost is immune to Normal (if covered)
	•	Fighting > Normal (important for Snorlax)
	•	Psychic > Poison (relevant to Venusaur/Gengar)
	•	Fairy > Fighting (relevant to Lucario matchups)
	•	Steel resists a lot (and is often a defensive type)

Study move: Drill with flashcards: “Type A attacks Type B — what happens?”

⸻

4) Battle Roles and “Why” Reasoning

You will likely see scenario questions like:
	•	“What would you switch into?”
	•	“Which move/type is best here?”
	•	“What’s the risk of this pick?”

Common roles (know the meaning)
	•	Attacker / Sweeper: tries to KO quickly
	•	Tank/Defender: survives hits and stays in
	•	Support: helps the team (status, healing, set-ups—intro level)
	•	Counter: chosen because it matches up well against a threat

Study move: For each focus Pokémon, write one sentence:

“This Pokémon usually plays the role of ___ because ___.”

⸻

5) Practice Questions You Should Be Ready For

Use these to self-check. (No answers here—treat it like a real study set.)

Identification
	1.	Name the type(s) of Charizard, Gengar, Lucario, Gyarados, Gardevoir.
	2.	Explain what “dual-type” means using a focus Pokémon example.

Matchups
	3.	What types threaten Charizard the most? Explain.
	4.	What type is the best answer into Pikachu and why?
	5.	Why is Fighting a common answer into Snorlax?

Forms
	6.	Explain the difference between “evolution” and “regional variant.”
	7.	Map an evolution line from memory (at least two full lines).

Reasoning (short answer style)
	8.	You face Gyarados: name two good attacking types and why.
	9.	You face Venusaur: name two good attacking types and why.

6) How to Study (a plan that works)

Step 1 — Build your “Focus 10 deck” (30–45 min)

Make 10 cards (paper or digital), each with:
	•	Type(s), 2 strengths, 2 weaknesses, role

Step 2 — Type drills (15 min/day for 5 days)

Shuffle a stack of type prompts:
	•	“Electric vs Water?”
	•	“Rock vs Fire/Flying?”
Answer out loud fast.

Step 3 — Scenario reps (2–3 sessions)

Write 8 mini-scenarios:
	•	“Opponent sends out ___.”
	•	“Best attack type is ___ because ___.”
This is where most people gain points.

Step 4 — Teach it to someone (or to the wall)

If you can explain it simply, you know it.

7) Final Self-Check (night before)

You’re ready if you can do all of this without notes:
	•	List the types of all 10 focus Pokémon
	•	Give 2 weaknesses for each
	•	Explain super-effective vs not very effective vs immunity
	•	Explain evolution line vs regional variant with examples
	•	Solve at least 5 battle scenarios with clear reasoning

If you want, tell me what format your final exam will be (percent matching vs multiple choice vs short answer vs battle scenarios), and I’ll tailor this into a one-page “last-minute cram sheet” plus a bigger full guide.
