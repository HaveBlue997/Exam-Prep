Course Description

This course is a hands-on introduction to the Pokémon universe through the lens of game literacy. You’ll learn foundational Pokémon knowledge (characters, evolution lines, and major forms/variants), and you’ll build real gameplay reasoning by mastering type strengths/weaknesses for 10 common Pokémon. We’ll use short labs, mini-battles, and creative assignments to make the learning stick.

Big Goals (What you’ll be able to do by the end)
	1.	Recognize major Pokémon by name, appearance, and role (starter, support, tank, sweeper, etc.).
	2.	Explain forms: evolution lines, regional variants, and at least two other form categories (ex: Mega, Gigantamax, alternate forms).
	3.	Use type matchups confidently to predict outcomes and justify choices.
	4.	Analyze 10 common Pokémon (below) including their typical strengths, weaknesses, and strategic identity.
	5.	Communicate game knowledge clearly through short write-ups, diagrams, and quick presentations.

The “10 Common Pokémon” Focus List (we’ll master these)

We’ll use these as our shared vocabulary all semester:
	1.	Pikachu (Electric)
	2.	Charizard (Fire/Flying)
	3.	Blastoise (Water)
	4.	Venusaur (Grass/Poison)
	5.	Gengar (Ghost/Poison)
	6.	Lucario (Fighting/Steel)
	7.	Gyarados (Water/Flying)
	8.	Eevee (Normal) + Eeveelutions overview
	9.	Snorlax (Normal)
	10.	Gardevoir (Psychic/Fairy)

Note: We’ll treat these as “case studies.” You’ll also learn many more Pokémon along the way.

Core Topics
	•	Pokédex literacy: categories, roles, stats basics (no deep math required)
	•	Evolution and forms: how and why Pokémon change
	•	Type chart fundamentals: offense vs defense, dual-types, immunities
	•	Battle thinking: prediction, synergy, counters (intro level)
	•	Ethical creation: making original fan-work without copying copyrighted assets

Materials / Tools
	•	Notebook or digital journal (your PokéJournal)
	•	Access to a type chart (provided)
	•	Optional: a battle sandbox tool (teacher-approved) for matchup practice
	•	Class handouts + slide deck

Grading (suggested)
	•	PokéJournal (weekly): 25% — notes, sketches, matchup logs
	•	Type Matchup Quizzes: 20% — quick, frequent, low-stakes
	•	Labs + Mini-Projects: 30% — group & solo work
	•	Case Study Presentation: 15% — teach one Pokémon deeply
	•	Participation/Teamwork: 10% — collaboration, discussion, readiness

Classroom Norms
	•	Be kind, be curious, be specific (“I think Water beats Fire because…”).
	•	We critique ideas, not people.
	•	Games are our text—analysis is the goal, not just winning.

Week 3: Evolution & Forms I — Evolution Lines
	•	Baby → Stage 1 → Stage 2; branching evolutions
	•	Journal task: map 5 evolution families

Week 4: Forms II — Variants & Special Forms

Major Assignments (what you’ll actually make)
	1.	PokéJournal (weekly)
	•	1 page/week: new Pokémon learned + one matchup diagram + one form note
	2.	Type Matchup Micro-Quizzes
	•	Fast, frequent; designed to improve memory with repetition
	3.	10 Pokémon Case Study Presentation (5–7 min)
	•	Pick one from the focus list. Teach: forms, strengths, weaknesses, and 2 matchup scenarios.
	4.	Original Variant Concept (mini-project)
	•	Create a new form concept for an existing Pokémon as a written design pitch (no copied art).
	•	Include type choice and matchup consequences.

Late Work (simple, fair)
	•	Small assignments: accepted up to 1 week late for partial credit
	•	Big projects: late only with a plan (talk to me early)

Academic Integrity / IP (important in game school)
	•	Don’t submit copied assets as “yours.”
	•	Fan analysis is fine; original work must be original.
	•	We’ll focus on design reasoning, not ripping game files.
