- Jan 14: Practice Quiz - Score: 28/35 (80%), missed dual-type questions

===============================================================================
FINAL EXAM SELF-CHECK (Use This Night Before)
===============================================================================

You're ready if you can do ALL of this without notes:

□ List the type(s) of all 10 Focus Pokémon from memory
□ Give 2 weaknesses for each Focus Pokémon
□ Give 2 strengths for each Focus Pokémon
□ State the battle role for each Focus Pokémon
□ Explain super-effective vs not very effective vs immunity with examples
□ Complete Fire-Water-Grass triangle instantly
□ Identify what beats Electric types (Ground)
□ Explain why Rock is devastating to Charizard (4x weakness)
□ Explain why Electric is devastating to Gyarados (4x weakness)
□ Explain evolution line vs regional variant with specific examples
□ Map at least 2 evolution lines from memory
□ Solve 5 battle scenarios with clear "because" reasoning
□ Explain what a Tank/Defender does vs an Attacker/Sweeper
□ Define all 10 vocabulary terms from midterm matching section

===============================================================================
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
===============================================================================

1. MAKE FLASHCARDS FOR THE FOCUS 10
   Physical or digital cards with Type, 2 Strengths, 2 Weaknesses, Role for each

2. DRILL TYPE MATCHUPS DAILY
   15 minutes a day beats 2 hours once a week; use rapid-fire Q&A

3. MASTER THE TRIANGLE FIRST
   Fire > Grass > Water > Fire is the foundation of everything else

4. FOCUS ON "WHY" NOT JUST "WHAT"
   Exam rewards reasoning: "Rock beats Charizard BECAUSE it hits both Fire AND Flying"

5. PRACTICE SHORT ANSWER FORMAT
   Use the template: "[Type] is good against [Pokémon] because [reason with type logic]"

6. KNOW YOUR 4x WEAKNESSES COLD
   Charizard + Rock and Gyarados + Electric are likely test questions

7. DISTINGUISH EVOLUTION FROM REGIONAL VARIANT
   Evolution = new species in a line; Regional variant = same Pokémon, different region/type

8. STUDY THE MIDTERM QUESTIONS
   The final will use similar formats; practice with the actual midterm questions

9. TEACH CONCEPTS OUT LOUD
   If you can explain it simply to someone else, you truly understand it

10. USE THE SELF-CHECK THE NIGHT BEFORE
    Go through every checkbox; any hesitation = review that topic immediately

Good luck!
