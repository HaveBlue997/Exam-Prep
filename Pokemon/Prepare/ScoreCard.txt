TIPS FOR SUCCESS
===============================================================================

1. Type matchups are THE foundation - drill them daily
2. Each focus Pokémon will appear on the final - know them cold
3. Scenario questions reward clear reasoning - always explain WHY
4. Evolution vs regional variant appears on every test
5. Dual-types are trickier - practice calculating combined effects
6. Battle roles help you think strategically, not just memorize
7. If stuck, think about type advantages first
8. Use the type chart for practice, aim to memorize core matchups
9. Teach concepts to someone else - best way to find gaps
10. Stay calm - you know this material!

Good luck, Trainer!
