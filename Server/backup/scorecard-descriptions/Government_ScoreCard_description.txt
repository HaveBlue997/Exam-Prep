I've created the Government ScoreCard.txt file with a comprehensive study plan based on analysis of all three course materials. The file includes:

- **45 total topics** organized by priority (15 high, 18 medium, 12 low)
- **High priority topics** focus on the two essay prompts (Articles vs. Constitution, Checks and Balances) plus frequently tested concepts
- **Quick reference charts** for memorizing checking powers, constitutional plans, federalism types, and key numbers
- **4-week study plan** with daily focus areas
- **Final exam self-check** covering all critical topics
- **10 course-specific study tips** based on the exam format and teacher's emphasis
